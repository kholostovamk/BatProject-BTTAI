# Predicting White-Nose Syndrome Spread in North American Bats

## Overview

This project is dedicated to predicting the spread of White Nose Syndrome (WNS), a devastating disease affecting bat populations across North America. By analyzing climate data alongside bat population and disease spread statistics, we aim to identify areas at high risk for WNS in the near future, specifically targeting the year 2024. The insights generated from this project are intended to support conservation efforts, inform stakeholders in agriculture and pharmaceuticals, and ultimately contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate the disease's impact.

## Project Background

White Nose Syndrome represents a significant threat to bat species, with implications for biodiversity and agriculture due to bats' role in pest control. Our machine learning model leverages data from various publicly available sources, including climate predictions and bat population studies, to forecast potential spread patterns of WNS. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can guide conservation strategies and research into treatments or preventions for the disease.

## Data and Methodology

Our analysis is grounded in data provided by BioInterphase and the NA-CORDEX project, encompassing bat population locations, instances of WNS detection, and regional climate forecasts. After preprocessing the data to address challenges such as data incompleteness and format inconsistencies, we conducted an exploratory data analysis to identify relevant features and patterns.

The project employs a range of machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, to model the disease's spread. These models were selected for their ability to handle the project's data characteristics, including the small dataset size and the need for interpretable results.

## Key Findings

The project's findings highlight the importance of climate factors, particularly mean precipitation, in the spread of WNS among bat populations. Our models suggest that areas with certain climate profiles are at a higher risk of experiencing WNS outbreaks. These insights underscore the potential for targeted conservation efforts and the need for further research into the relationship between climate and WNS spread.

## Conclusion

Our predictive model represents a step forward in understanding and mitigating the spread of White Nose Syndrome in North American bats. While the model provides important insights, ongoing data collection and analysis are crucial for refining predictions and developing effective conservation strategies.
